Sway
====
ACTIVELY IN DEV:

OLD: Translate smartphone sensor data into control data (OSC, MIDI, DMX) via a browser.

NEW: Sway manages multi-user connectivity to route user data (source-agnostic) into output data.
Smartphone sensor code is being refactored into Shui, while client handling code is being moved to sway-client

See wiki for all (scant at the moment) documentation.




What if Sway was like express, but for realtime data?
